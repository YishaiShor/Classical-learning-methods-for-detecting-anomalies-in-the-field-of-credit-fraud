# Classical-learning-methods-for-detecting-anomalies-in-the-field-of-credit-fraud

In this project I present several ways to identify anomalies in the field of credit fraud. The project is structured as follows:
1. A theoretical part where I define the problem, present the literature in the field, and detail the principles underlying the algorithms I will use in the solution.
2. An empirical part where I present solutions for supervised and unsupervised learning to identify anomalies.
